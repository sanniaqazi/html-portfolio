<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a new and emerging web designer with over 10 years of non-profit experience. I have good experience in the realm of planning, strategy and evaluation in both internal consulting/advisory roles, and within large- and small-scale contexts, and this would be helpful in working on different types of projects. For example, I have worked with UN-OIOS, on the formative evaluation of the UN system’s support to the Member States in implementation of the SDG’s.  Most recently at the Ford Foundation, I worked with the Office of Strategy and Learning to help global teams design indicators for their respective 4-year strategic outcomes. At the Open Society Foundations, I served on the technical support wing for assessment practice to the $1 billion philanthropic network. We worked together with OSF’s program teams to design and advocate for an effective strategy and planning cycle that is structured to not only achieve goals, but to also foster learning and accountability. The role demanded a great deal of creativity to accommodate and support a network of offices that span across cultures, issues, regions, and team styles. Both organizations place a strong emphasis on equity and diversity in their approaches to work, and we worked to build support tools for them accordingly. At Islamic Relief USA, my position as the Middle East/North Africa Grants Officer involved the effective oversight of a $20 million portfolio of grantees, a large portion of which was dedicated to the Syrian refugee crisis. With the Zakat Foundation, I helped to establish their M&E processes through the establishment of a training manual, creation of a toolkit for grantees and field offices, as well as performing M&E trips to sites across the world.  

  Other examples from my consulting experience include conducting a philanthropic landscape analysis for the Bervann Foundation, helping research measures in early childhood education for First5, and building a funding strategy with an NGO working in Kashmir.
